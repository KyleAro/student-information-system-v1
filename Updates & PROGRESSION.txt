BUG INFORMATION

1.SEARCH STUDENT INFORMATION	
	the search student cannot access the allstudents list 
	and does not print the information of students

2. VERIFY STUDENT
	AFTER THE MAXIMIZED ATTEMPTS WAS EXHAUSTED IT 
	FORGETS THE INFORMATION ADDED SO IT DELETES THE INFO AND
	CANNOT BE USED AGAIN EVEN IF THE PROGRAM HAS NOT BEEN CLOSED YET.

BUG SOLUTIONS:
1. SEARCH STUDENT INFORMATION
	JUST SIMPLY  GET THE StudentIDSearcher class FILE AND USE IT AS 
	searchstud and then just called the student that is valued 
	as the student info and then in the main class we created a variable
	that stores the searchstud function and hold the student args(which contains the student info class that has the allstudents list)
2.VERIFY STUDENT
	instead of returning the main funct, i returned to the verify student function so that it just loop back to itself instead of repeating the whole main process.
